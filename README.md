# SimpleConsole

This is a C application using the consoul.net dll to display and interact with a *Consoul* console window.

Originally created with Visual Studio, it has been converted for the PellesC development environment (also use of <tchar.h> dropped).
SimpleConsole.exe has no other dependencies than the *Consoul* dll [which can be downloaded from here](https://consoul.net/docs/downloads/).

More information on the [consoul.net C docs](https://consoul.net/docs/c/) page.
